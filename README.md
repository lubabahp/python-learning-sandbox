My sandbox for beginner python experiments and mini practice scripts. Everything here is self-taught and explanatory. 

I used this repo starting out to practise getting used to syntax, creating small scripts and solving small problems to get used to Python before starting to build any projects. I still commit in it sometimes to warm-up and refresh skills, or when I feel like a script doesn't belong in any separate repo.
