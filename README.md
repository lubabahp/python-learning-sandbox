My sandbox for beginner python experiments and mini practice scripts. Everything here is self-taught and explanatory. I used this repo to practise getting used to syntax, creating small scripts and solving small problems to get used to Python before starting to build any projets. I still commit in it to warm-up and refresh skills.
