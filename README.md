My sandbox for beginner python experiments and mini practice scripts. Everything here is self-taught and explanatory. I used this repo to practise getting used to syntax, creating small scripts and solving small problems to get used to Python before starting to build any projets, and often commit in it to warm-up and refresh skills.
