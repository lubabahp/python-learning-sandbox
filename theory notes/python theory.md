<h3> variables in python: </h3>
- a variable is essentially a placeholder for info you would want python to recall later.
- a single variable can't have spaces, otherwise python reads them as seperate variables.
- can include letters, numbers, and underscores but can't start with a number, and is usually descriptive of the data.
