1. mess around for syntax comfort: can be brute force copying someone else's code, tweaking, breaking stuff
2. force application of new syntax knowledge via mini projects. iterate old projects with new features learned, build new ones too - both are valuable skills.
3. read other people's code, copy and modify.
4. debugging naturally comes when you make your own projects, but practise debugging other people's code too. 

so... there is nothing more to teaching yourself programming in any language!
