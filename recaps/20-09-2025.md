### learning recap - 20th Sept 2025
- variables, printing variables
- either quotation marks for strings
- python starts counting from 0
- len() = length of string
- type() = prints type of data the variable is. int, float, str
- casting is specifying data type. like c=str(7) therefore 7 will behave like a string and not an integer.
- bool() tells you whether a variable is true or false.

- name = input("What's your name? ") 
so, "name" is a variable that the user decides what it is because of input()
- if else and elif.
- .lower() means inputs processed the same regardless of case
- square brackets for lists

- creating functions with def
- for example, def your_function_here():
- while loops; used to repeat a function infinitely until a condition is met.

- random.choice() lets python pick variables from a list of variables


* how do i make line breaks?
* list, tuples, ranges?
* {} is for variables?
* i dont get why "f" is put sometimes before a string being printed
